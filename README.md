### Unknown Authors:
I couldn't find the original authors for the items listed below, but the current 
forms where modified by me:

* Image of raven cawing: edited with the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) to make 
  background black and white, while keeping the actual raven colored. 
* Rain / thunder sounds: Taken from several unrelated recordings and cut apart 
  using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/). For the thunder, the background 
  sound of rain was removed using the "Noise Reduction" effect with the following 
  settings:
    * **Noise reduction (dB)**: 12
    * **Sensitivity**: 1.00
    * **Frequency smoothing (bands)**: 3
    * **Noise**: Reduce

## Usage
This is designed to be run locally on a computer and not a web server, although 
that's entirely possible to do. Simply download it and put it somewhere safe, and 
point your browser start page setting to it. 

**Hint:** Use something along these lines...

* Windows: "file:///C:/Users/*USERNAME*/Documents/*...whatever...*"
* Linux: "file:///home/*USERNAME*/*...whatever...*"
